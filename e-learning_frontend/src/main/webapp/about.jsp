<h1>Elearning</h1>
A learning system based on formalised teaching but with the help of electronic resources 
is known as E-learning. While teaching can be based in or out of the classrooms, the use
of computers and the Internet forms the major component of E-learning.E-learning can also 
be termed as a network enabled transfer of skills and knowledge, and the delivery of 
education is made to a large number of recipients at the same ordifferent times. Earlier, 
it was not accepted wholeheartedly as it was assumed that this system lacked the human
element required in learning.
